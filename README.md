## Hello there
# I am Eric Giunchi: welcome to my website!

# My background
I am a PhD student at INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, in Padua, Italy. My work is currently focused on the reduction and analysis of a set of images taken with the HST/WFC3. The targets are six galaxies undergoing strong ram-pressure stripping inside galaxy clusters, showing long tails of young stellar clumps, of which we have studied the star-forming and morphological properties.
My scientific interests include star formation in peculiar environment, unresolved stellar population properties, morphological and photometric evolution of stellar clumps and clusters.
