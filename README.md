# About me

My scientific work is oriented to the study of star formation, focusing on very young stellar clumps observed in different environments. In order to do that, during my PhD program, I studied a set of HST/WFC3 images of six galaxies undergoing strong ram-pressure stripping inside galaxy clusters, showing long tails of stellar clumps, of which we have studied the star-forming and morphological properties. The comparison of these clumps with those observed in "normal" galaxies can help unveiling which physical mechanisms drive the formation of new stars.

Besides the study of the star-formation process and driving mechanisms, my interests include the evolution of groups and clusers of stars, either as a consequence of stellar evolution and dynamical interactions.
