# About me

At the moment, my scientific work is mainly oriented on the study of the star-formation mechanism, focusing on very young stellar clumps observed in different environments. In order to do that, during my PhD program, I studied a set of HST/WFC3 images of six galaxies undergoing strong ram-pressure stripping inside galaxy clusters, showing long tails of stellar clumps, of which we have studied the star-forming and morphological properties.

Besides the study of the star-formation process and driving mechanisms, my interests include the evolution of groups and clusers of stars, either as a consequence of stellar evolution and dynamical interactions.
