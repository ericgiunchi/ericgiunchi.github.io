My scientific work is mainly oriented to the study of **star formation**, focusing on very young stellar clumps observed in different environments. In order to do that, during my PhD program I studied a set of _HST/WFC3_ images of six galaxies undergoing strong **ram-pressure stripping** inside galaxy clusters, showing long tails of stellar clumps, of which we have studied the star-forming and morphological properties. The comparison of these clumps with those observed in "normal" galaxies can help unveiling which physical mechanisms drive the formation of new stars.

My scientific interests include:
1. star-formation driving processes;
2. timescales of the different steps of star formation, from gas collapse to the decoupling of stars and gas;
3. galaxy evolution in peculiar enviroments like galaxy clusters;
4. evolution of groups and clusters of stars, either as a consequence of stellar evolution and dynamical interactions;
5. dwarf galaxies formation in galaxy clusters.
